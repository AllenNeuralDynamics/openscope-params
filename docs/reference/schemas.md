## schemas

- [`schemas/launcher/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/1.0.0.json) — Top-level schema for OpenScope launcher parameter files. This schema is intentionally permissive (additionalProperties=true) while providing structured validation and documentation for common keys and pipeline entry formats.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/experiment_notes_editor/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/experiment_notes_editor/1.0.0.json) — Creates/opens an experiment notes file within the session folder and optionally launches an external editor so the operator can edit notes pre-acquisition.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/experiment_notes_finalize/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/experiment_notes_finalize/1.0.0.json) — Post-acquisition notes step: optionally preview notes content and prompt the operator to confirm notes are complete.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_procedures_fetch/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_procedures_fetch/1.0.0.json) — Fetches procedure(s) metadata for the subject from the configured metadata service and records results for downstream validation and record-keeping.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_project_validator/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_project_validator/1.0.0.json) — Validates that the project associated with the session/subject matches expectations. Typically compares an expected project name against metadata service results and may prompt the operator on mismatch.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_protocol_validator/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_protocol_validator/1.0.0.json) — Validates that the protocol associated with the session/subject matches expectations (by name and/or protocol id). May prompt the operator on mismatch.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_subject_fetch/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/metadata_subject_fetch/1.0.0.json) — Fetches subject metadata from the configured metadata service and writes results into the session folder for downstream modules.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/session_archiver/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/session_archiver/1.0.0.json) — Archives session outputs from a source session directory to a network destination, optionally writing a manifest and verifying checksums.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/session_creator/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/session_creator/1.0.0.json) — Creates the session folder structure (and often initializes metadata files) before acquisition begins.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_bonsai/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_bonsai/1.0.0.json) — Post-acquisition enhancement step for Bonsai-based sessions. Typically reads outputs from the session folder and writes standardized/derived metadata. Most configuration is inferred from the session folder.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_predictive_processing/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_predictive_processing/1.0.0.json) — Post-acquisition enhancement for predictive-processing sessions. Typically computes/collects derived metadata and writes standardized files into the session folder.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_slap2/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/session_enhancer_slap2/1.0.0.json) — Post-acquisition enhancement for SLAP2 sessions. Adds standardized session metadata such as FOV location, magnification, and session type to downstream metadata products.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/stimulus_table_predictive_processing/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/stimulus_table_predictive_processing/1.0.0.json) — Generates or validates the predictive-processing stimulus table within the session folder. This module typically relies on top-level session context (e.g. output_session_folder) rather than additional parameters.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/zmq_ready_publisher/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/zmq_ready_publisher/1.0.0.json) — Publishes a ZMQ 'ready' message to signal downstream components that acquisition can proceed.
- [`schemas/launcher/modules/zmq_ready_waiter/1.0.0.json`](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/openscope-params/blob/main/schemas/launcher/modules/zmq_ready_waiter/1.0.0.json) — Waits for a ZMQ 'ready' message from an upstream component. Used to block until a dependency reports readiness.
